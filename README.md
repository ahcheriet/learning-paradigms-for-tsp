# On Learning Paradigms for the Travelling Salesman Problem

This repository contains code for the paper 
[**"On Learning Paradigms for the Travelling Salesman Problem"**]()
by Chaitanya K. Joshi, Thomas Laurent and Xavier Bresson, presented at the [NeurIPS 2019 Graph Representation Learning Workshop](https://grlearning.github.io/overview/).

We explore the impact of learning paradigms on training deep neural networks for the Travelling Salesman Problem. 
We design controlled experiments to train supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) models on fixed graph sizes up to 100 nodes, and evaluate them on variable sized graphs up to 500 nodes.
Beyond not needing labelled data, out results reveal favorable properties of RL over SL:
RL training leads to better *emergent* generalization to variable graph sizes and 
is a key component for learning scale-invariant solvers for novel combinatorial problems.
